# Design, Decisions & Thoughts

Hello ðŸ‘‹,

Thanks for putting the assessment together. I enjoyed taking the chalenge, though it stretched me in some areas. Below are some things in my implementation that I believe are worthy of note.

## What Counts ?

### Requirements
1.  âœ… Backend - Using Node, Express & Typescript:
    -   âœ… Create a single **REST** endpoint to retrieve a list of Magic cards from the Scryfall API based on a provided search string from the client.
    -   âœ… Read the Scryfall API url from a `.env` file (in dev mode) / environment variables (in prod)
2.  âœ… Frontend - Using React & Typescript:
    -   âœ… Build a search bar to input a card name to search and then make a call to your Node endpoint to lookup cards. The search should work <ins>without</ins> the user needing to click a button. And it should be impossible for a user to submit more than `1` API request per second using this search bar.
    -   âœ… Display the card results to the user. All cards must display the following: The card's image(s), name, set name, number, and rarity.
3.  âœ… General TypeScript/ES6 knowledge
4.  âœ… Bonus:
    -   âœ… Node endpoint tested using a framework of your choice
    -   âœ… Frontend pagination. Not enough time to support sorting results in the UI, but it is supported in the API/backend
    -   âœ… Design aesthetically pleasing and responsive in the browser
    -   âœ… Entire interface is styled using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com)
