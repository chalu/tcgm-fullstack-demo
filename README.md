# Introduction

Hello ðŸ‘‹,

This is a simple but production-leve full stack application demo built as part of the requirements for the TCG Machines Senior Fullstack Software Engineer role.

Review the [instructions](./INSTRCTIONS.md) for what was expected and then take a look at the [explanation](./DESIGN_EXPLANATION.md) for my implementation details.

## Usage

With the latest Node LTS & Pnpm installed, run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Backend

To start the backend search service, run:

```bash
pnpm --filter searchservice build
pnpm --filter searchservice start
```

You should now have a Node server running on port **3001**

### Frontend

To start the frontend React app, run:

```bash
pnpm --filter r-seeker build
pnpm --filter r-seeker start:local
```

You should now have `http-server` serving the built React app from a URL displayed on the terminal. Open the URL in a browser to see the app.

### Tests

To test the backend search service, run:

```bash
pnpm --filter searchservice start:dev
```

then open another terminal window/tab and run:

```bash
pnpm --filter searchservice test
```
