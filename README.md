# Introduction

Hello ðŸ‘‹,

This is a simple but production-leve full stack application demo built as part of the requirements for the TCG Machines Senior Fullstack Software Engineer role. 

Review the [instructions](./INSTRCTIONS.md) for what was expected and then take a look at the [explanation](./DESIGN_EXPLANATION.md) for my implementation details.

> ##### Key Assets Delivered
> ---
> 1. The backend [API spec]('https://github.com/chalu/tcgm-fullstack-demo/blob/main/api/spec/api.yaml'), deployed at [https://tcg-api-demo.onrender.com]('https://tcg-api-demo.onrender.com')
> 2. The backend [search service](https://github.com/chalu/tcgm-fullstack-demo/tree/main/server/searchservice), deployed at [https://tcg-backend-demo.onrender.com]('https://tcg-backend-demo.onrender.com/')
> 3. The frontend [React search client](https://github.com/chalu/tcgm-fullstack-demo/tree/main/client/r-seeker), deployed at [https://tcg-react-client-demo.onrender.com]('https://tcg-react-client-demo.onrender.com')


## Usage

With the latest Node LTS & Pnpm installed, run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
```

#### Backend

To start the backend search service, run:

```bash
pnpm --filter searchservice build
pnpm --filter searchservice start
```
You should now have a Node server running on port **3001**

#### Frontend

To start the frontend React app, run:

```bash
pnpm --filter r-seeker build
pnpm --filter r-seeker start:local
```
You should now have `http-server` serving the built React app from a URL displayed on the terminal. Open the URL in a browser to see the app.

#### Tests

To test the backend search service, run:

```bash
pnpm --filter searchservice start:dev
```
then open another terminal window/tab and run:

```bash
pnpm --filter searchservice test
```
